# Tango With Django
Welcome to my implementation of the [Tango With Django Tutorial](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/)!

The aim of this tutorial was to get me up and running with my first Django web
application. I completed the tutorial in a few days, learning how to:
* Setup a development environment.
* Setup a Django project to serve static media and other media files.
* Work with Djangoâ€™s Model-View-Template design pattern.
* Create database models and use the object relational mapping functionality
provided by Django.
* Create forms that can utilise your database models to create dynamically
generated webpages.
* Use the User Authentication services provided by Django.
* Incorporate external services into the application.
* Include Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript within a web
application.
* Design and apply CSS to improve the look and feel of the web application.
* Work with cookies and sessions with Django.
